		  violations or con-creteness ratings to detect metaphors in
		  text. These features rely on background corpora, hand-coded
		  rules or additional, manually created resources, all
		  specific to the language the system is being used on. We
		  present a novel approach to metaphor detection using a
		  neural network in combination with word embeddings, a
		  method that has already proven to yield promising results

		  comparable results to other systems, while removing the
		  need for additional resources.},

  abstract	= {TensorFlow is a machine learning system that operates at
		  large scale and in heterogeneous environments. TensorFlow
		  uses dataflow graphs to represent computation, shared
		  state, and the operations that mutate that state. It maps
		  the nodes of a dataflowgraph across many machines in a
		  cluster, and within a machine across multiple computational
		  devices, including multicore CPUs, generalpurpose GPUs, and
		  custom-designed ASICs known as Tensor Processing Units
		  (TPUs). This architecture gives flexibility to the
		  application developer: whereas in previous "parameter
		  server" designs the management of shared state is built
		  into the system, TensorFlowenables developers to experiment
		  with novel optimizations and training algorithms.
		  TensorFlow supports a variety of applications, with a focus
		  on training and inference on deep neural networks. Several
		  Google services use TensorFlow in production, we have
		  released it as an open-source project, and it has become
		  widely used for machine learning research. In this paper,
		  we describe the TensorFlow dataflow model and demonstrate
		  the compelling performance that TensorFlow achieves for
		  several real-world applications.},

  abstract	= {Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are
		  very powerful machine learning systems. However,
		  overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large
		  networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal
		  with overfitting by combining the predictions of many
		  different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a
		  technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to
		  randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the
		  neural network during training. This prevents units from
		  co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from
		  an exponential number of different “thinned” networks.
		  At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of
		  averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by
		  simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller
		  weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives
		  major improvements over other regularization methods. We
		  show that dropout improves the performance of neural
		  networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech
		  recognition, document classification and computational
		  biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many
		  benchmark data sets},
